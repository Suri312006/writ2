# Step 1

## Purpose

- To caution those who use AI tools for software engineering to at least be
aware of the fact that usage of AI-generated code could be in the realm of
copyright fairly soon.

- On a slightly smaller scale, to dissuade the usage of AI tools.

## Audience

- Anyone currently using AI tools for code assistance or code generation.

- People who aren't very familiar with the domain but are interested in
the paper.

- Developers in general.

## Context

- The developer community and companies, at large, have been advertising
and jumping on the AI hype train.

- There's also been discussions on regulating copyright AI content, with
the only struggle being not many relevant precedents, which is soon to change.

## Text

- I want it to be in the format of a scientific paper, as I want more
experience with it.

- I want a section with a good amount of background information to make the
subject matter more approachable for unfamiliar readers.

# Step 2

1. I mostly just used my thesis statement and reworded it a bit in my purpose
section, but something that did jump out at me is my internal bias against AI
development tools, mostly due to their impact on learning and skill atrophy,
but I'm not sure if I have any capability to make resistance happen on a
larger scale.

2. I didn't have any uncertainties about my audience because it's honestly
pretty clear from the topic at hand who it'll be most relevant to. I also
wanted it to be approachable for people not well-versed in the field, and
I think that pretty much covers my needs. I'll have a background section to
help people learn the basics to allow them to understand the paper.

3. The context of my writing situation is kind of just a summary of the
recent events that have happened in the field. There's been a large amount
of marketing and "corporate propaganda" that I want to take a stance against
in my paper.

4. I mostly want to focus on having the IEEE format because it's something
I want to get good at.

5. This writing situation is quite unique to me because I've never had this
much open freedom in what I've been asked to write before, so I'm having a
really fun time experimenting.
