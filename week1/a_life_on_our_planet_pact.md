# Purpose

- To provoke some change in the audience to do something?
- money (for netflix)
  - The more I think about it, the more i think this is the case, cashing out Attenboroughs credibility before he croaks
- If they truly wanted real, tangible change regarding the environment, budget from this film would go towards lobbying / working with agencies to promote new laws.
  - maybe thats something they mention in the film and I just dont know since I havent seen it.

# Audience

- The average person with a netflix subscription
- Ideally people who are actually in charge, but not sure how heavily this documentary would sway their descisions.
- We've seen, and frankly gotten desensitized to climate change warnings before, why would this documentary be any different.

# Context

- The modern day
- climate change
- David Attenborough's life as a documentary commentator / biologist / scientist
  - gives him credibility to be speaking on this topic
- Species are dying ever since we started global warming

# Text

- there was no text
- David Attenboroughs voice, taking about his experiences, giving himself credibility
- Visuals of the beauty of our planet near the beginning, to dying animals / in terrible conditions near the end
- the visuals paralleled his speech
  - giving a visual to his words, makes it more enjoyable as a watcher, easier to be engaged
  - The visuals themselves were quite stunning, the production budget really shows
