1. Project 4 Argument
  For those concerned with the legality of the software they produce, the usage of
AI-generated code should be avoided as soon as possible, as it could become susceptible to
copyright law shortly.

2. Purpose
The purpose of my project 5 is to try to approach the topic from the
mindest of someone whos really enthusiastic and passionate about AI. Ideally
it would argue against my thesis, saying that AI is revolutionary and
everyone should embrace using this new technology. They would try to convince
their reader to continue their usage since the benefits provided outweigh the
cons of facing copyright.

3. Audience
The audience of this piece would be those who already use AI daily
to work on programming projects. I want to reach them because I want to increase /
share in my common interest in using AI. I want to shape my text to be easy
to understand and appeal to pathos so the reader can relate more to me as the
author and ideally be imprinted.


4. Genre
I want to make a semi-serious, fictional but grounded reality blog post
because it's what's common with the kinds of people who use AI daily.
It's effective because blogs are usually the sort of place that I and
many others get new/exciting news or respond to things that are happening
in the community.

5. Medium
The medium is probably going to a blog that I put up on my website, where I
post as my devil's advocate, and probably take it down after grading is over. It's a
cool way to submit it, but it would impact the visibility of my work.


6. Next Steps
To be completely honest I haven't started writing my project 5 yet since I've had a lot going on
but it's looking to be pretty fun. I just hope that ill be able to use my blog as a
submission medium.
