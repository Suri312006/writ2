= Step One

Being in nature is beneficial to you.

= Step Two

== Purpose:
  - To convince the reader that going outside isnt beneficial to you always.
  - That without enough precaution it could end up being even more dangerous than the benefits
    gained from being outside.

== Audience: 
  - People who are already biased against going outside / in nature.

== Context:
  - There are quite a few dangerous things outside, think of malaria, dengue,
    pests, venemous animals, etc...
  - Not everyone is super well educated about nature.

== Text:
  - It's hard for me to directly argue that going in nature is bad, so its
    easier to pivot my argument towards people that are already hesitant
    towards going outside and provide evidence of how there are certain dangers
    outside that the common person wouldn't know.
    - all kinds of spiders, snakes, veneomous animals.

  - I would try to reach my audience by using logos and ethos, kind of charging
    my logical statements with an appeal to their fear of death, even though that
    sounds really morbid, to make my claim hit harder.
