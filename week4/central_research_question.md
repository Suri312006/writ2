# My central research question

Currently, my central research question is: How does existing copyright
law apply to the usage of AI output, especially in the field of software
engineering? The only concern I have with my research question is whether
or not the current sources I have are enough to cover all the knowledge
I need to write a comprehensive paper, so I'll probably have to look into
more sources. A source I am interested in looking into is the Google LLC
v. Oracle America, Inc. case, which was a groundbreaking Supreme Court case
that has set a precedent for copyright in coding.

A source that has helped me learn some background in the field of copyright
is Art and Copyright by Simon Stokes because it provides a good introduction
to copyright and how it’s interpreted with "human" violators. It even has
an AI section, but I haven’t read that yet.

Another really intriguing source
that I enjoyed reading was this research paper -
https://ucsc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CDL_SCR_INST/ojisf2/cdi_ieee_primary_10440501,
which has some really interesting findings regarding tracing back code
output by AI to its source material, something I definitely want to use in
my research paper.

My gut answer (maybe I’m just biased) is that it has to be some form of
copyright infringement for OpenAI or any other training model to simply pluck
data from a source, train their AI with it, and have that AI spit it back out,
and then say that it’s totally legit. It’s an interesting field since,
at least in the US, there hasn’t been any precedent set by the Supreme
Court, so no one really knows what to do.

Recently, OpenAI has accused DeepSeek of "stealing" OpenAI's model data/outputs
to help train their own AI, R1, and this is another interesting thing I
could dive into, i.e., Is DeepSeek really stealing by accused OpenAI's data
if the data was never OpenAI's in the first place?

Overall, I'm quite enthusiastic about my topic and looking forward to finding
more sources before I can come up with a plan for my research paper.
