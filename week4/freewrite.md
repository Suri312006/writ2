METHOD: freewrite
  My topic is to look into the use of copyright regarding the usage of AI
, but i really want to look into how it can impact this field that im really interested in.
Ive used ai to help me with code / to write some boiler plate but is that
technically an illegality? It's something that ive even seen reccomended by
old youtubers I used to learn from, and especially something thats being used by my peers.
I need to read more of the sources to be honest, and find more regarding copyright
and code. Google v Oracle would be a really good read but lowkey just really stacked this
weekend with so much work. Definetly try to read the court case and oh yeah the
paper was also really intreseting because of its, possible, capabilities to
look backwards from the perspective of an ai model and see if any code was
derived from a source. Although im not really sure how copyright would
entail towards code, so maybe I want to look towards licensing of code
and how openai scraped licensed repositores and if that code were to be used, that
would have to be a much more credible way to snipe it. Lots of ways to go about it
but honestly i should probably read more of my sources as a solid first step.
