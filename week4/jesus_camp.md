Purpose:
- To educate the audience about the happenings inside of so called "jesus camps"
- How religious indoctrination starts from a young age, via good sounding communal gatherings
  with a twisted subplot?

Audience:
- Those who have a prior bias against religious groups
- average documentary watcher whos interest is piqued by the trailer
- Those who believe maybe? I'm 100% sure that theres people who still see this as wrong even if they are religious.

Context: 
- Religion vs Atheism
- a crumbling of the seperation of church and state that
  has occurred over the last few years.
- indoctrination of children stands out to me, that one lady used the word "enemies", very powerful

Text:
- Goes from a positive portrayal into a "darker" tone.
- starts off with children happy to have found god
- ends with some, honestly kind of cultish scenes.
- One lady in the middle says that her enemies are teaching kids to throw grenades, so it marks a sinister tone to whats going on.

Alter Ego.
I think my alter ego would feel persuaded by this film to watch children learn about the faith, especially from the scenes in he begging. As the
trailer goes on though, im fairly sure that he would be upset with the villanization of other peoples, and hopefully call out
untrue statements made by that lady. Maybe I'm being too hopeful but I think my alter ego would walk away from this
documentary with a renewed understanding of the harm caused by jesus camps.
