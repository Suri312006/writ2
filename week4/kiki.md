What is their gut reaction?
- Definetly something on the spectrum of discomfort? Probably because they arent exposed to this kind of content as often.

Are they inclined to be receptive to this?
- I dont necessarily think they would be inclined, maybe just turn the show off, or be dismissive.

What did this video make them think about, or feel?
- the last line in the trailer was that everyone just wants to love, I hope my alter ego would realize that
he shares more with this person than he may realize, and maybe that will help him be more accepting?
