Out of all these videos i think my alter ego would resonate the most with
the redpill video, as its something thats deeply personal to him, seeeing
his fellow veterans suffering and also the cruelty of the war he survived.
As per the video about Kiki, im not completely sure whether or not they would
dislike the video or just be avoidant towards it, as its not something ive completely
thought about regarding my alter ego's stances on this matters. I want
them to be someone who loves regardless but im not sure whether real
examples of my alter ego would. 

It is extremely difficult to try and analyze a piece of media from another persons view,
especially if theyre polar opposite to mine because I'm not really thinking about
it on my first watch through. I already make my own assumptions and understandings about
what is going on. Then, after the watch through, its really hard to disassemble my
biases and try to recontruct them to reflect my alter ego's. Overall one of the hardest
, non-writing, things I've had to do in a writing class.
