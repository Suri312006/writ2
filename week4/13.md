<What is their gut reaction to this video? (Eg. how do they automatically react to it without thinking too hard?)
What do they think the purpose of the video is? The argument? Are they inclined to be receptive to this? 
What did this video make them think about, or feel? 

My alter ego's gut reaction to this video would be curiosity im assuming? wondering
how corrupt / unfair the government is with helping people become better instead
of exploiting them for war / free labor. I'm unsure whether they have any direct
cause to be receptive to this story, so no, they would not be receptive to this.
I think it makes them feel bad honestly, for the people imprisoned unjustly.
