From the perspective of your alter ego, reflect on this videoâ€™s use of
pathos, ethos, logos.  In what ways does your alter-ego think this video
makes appeals to pathos, ethos, and/or logos?  Does your alter ego find
these appeals to be effective?  Why or why not? Spend about 5-10 minutes
writing down this reflection.  There's no length requirement for this exercise.

I think my alter ego would heavily resonate with this video, being
a veteran himself, he would really feel the appeals the guy in the
video made when he said that "we are the ones who are dying".
I believe that sentence is going to be the most convincing
piece of pathos to hook my alter ego. Additionally the statistics
that show the amount of men dying to workplace accidents /
war would also impact my alter ego quite heavily. As for ethos,
I dont think he would react to much credibility as the
first two motivational devices would take precedence.
