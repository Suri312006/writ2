1. I think a lot of my letter consists of Ethos because I'm asking the audience
(me from the past) to blindly trust that this letter comes from the future,
and only then will anything make sense. Not sure if that completely made
sense, but if they don't trust that I'm who I say I am, then the letter
holds no meaning, so the value/trustworthiness of my letter comes from the
acceptance that I am who I say I am. I would say not much of my letter is
really an argument, but there is one part, in the second paragraph, where I'm
trying to motivate myself to explore things more, using logos to accentuate
the fact that I don't really have much free time anymore, so now's the time
(well, technically in the past) to explore and have fun. As for Pathos, there's
quite a bit of that in the last paragraph to emotionally support myself, as
I was not doing so great in the time when I (theoretically) read this letter.

2. I think my reliance on all 3 forms was mostly fairly distributed, with
each one kind of getting their own paragraph.

3. I think the part of my letter that was the strongest is an appeal to pathos
near the end where I say that everything is gonna be alright, mostly because
it's the hardest-hitting thing emotionally and because it's just a nice way
to end this letter, which would also maybe prove my authenticity? Like I
really do care for myself.

4. No. I don't really want to persuade my past self to do much more than
I did in the letter, mostly because it feels kind of like a violation of
free will. If I ask them to change something with an even greater emphasis,
it doesn't sit well with me morally. Additionally, it might even seem a bit
shallow/not authentic if I were trying to push a very strong "agenda."

5. I don't think there are really any logical fallacies because that's not
the kind of letter I wrote to myself, but if I had to point out some, it
was that I warn myself of the hardships I'll face but also, near the end,
say that things are gonna be alright. It could maybe be taken as a fallacy
(especially if you squint a little), but I don't think that counts.

6. I made the rhetorical decisions I made to simply just talk to myself
from the past and tell him some things that I've been thinking about myself
now too. Sort of giving him a heads-up. I'm really happy with the style of
writing I used in my letter, it just feels right for the message at hand.
