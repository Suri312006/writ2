# Whats better? interpreters or compilers?

## interpreted languages
- Javascript
- Python
- Lua
- Haskell?
- Ocaml?
- java?
- nix?

## compiled languages

llvm family
- rust
- c/cpp
- zig

runtime
- go

idk
- swift


You get more freedom with an interpreted language but
that comes with performance tradeoff's.
Is there a best paradigm for general purpose programming?
What about which language would be the best for that?
Maybe I could come up with a guideline for what would be best in certain scenarios
What differentiates between the two?
performance?
llvm has optimised compiler technology for 30 years so if you want performance
you want to go there.
Interpreted languages usually have better type systems / dont have memory leaks
should I go over memory safety as a condition? Theres a lot that can go into
this research but a core question needs to be formed. I also want to write so that
the layperson could understand what im even talking about.
