Journal Entry
It was a good week this week. The crops were growing nicely, not any sign of pests. It was a nice day out, so I took the kiddos out to see the sun.
I cleared up June's gravestone in the noon, some crappy branhes were laying over it. I see her in my dreams, reminiscing about the past, she was beautiful.
I still dont think its right what happened to her, those scummy sons of bitches. They refused to cover her chemo so she chose to die so we wouldnt
have to sell our house. I love you June, I hope you're watching over me from up there. I'm sorry I couldnt do more for you.
"Father, please forgive me when I allow anger and bitterness to fill my heart because I refuse to forgive someone who has hurt me.
Teach me how to lay down my rights and choose to forgive in the same way You have forgiven me.". I hope I can get rid of
this hatefullness in my heart.

I spend some time with the kids in the afternoon, showed them around the farm while riding in
my tractor. Their smiles brightened my day. Claudia kept saying that it was too dangerous
to have them up there but it turned out just fine. Doug's been saying that
the crops are starting to wilt cuz of the heat. Eitherways itll turn out alright,
crops have had bad years in my day too but we still survived. Folks on the news
are calling it "climate change" and i've never heard of anything bad happening
from burning a lamp. Then again they're some smart folks arguing for it. I'm unsure who to trust
on both sides.

The elections coming up soon and Doug wont shut up about Trump. Claudia winces whenever she
hears the name but Doug seems to not care, he thinks that he'll get more help from the tax
cuts and who knows maybe the yield will increase next year too. Might as well try to
help doug out and vote for Trump too. I remember the good years of Reagan, another republican,
maybe Trump will live up to the hype.

My body is starting to hurt. My knee started killing me on my evening walk. I knew its
been coming for a few years now, but I didnt think it'd be so soon. The rough work
in the marines during my 20's really caught up with me. Doug said we could try getting
it checked out once he sells the yield. June would have cared more. It feels powerless
when you're old, not much you can do.

I walked with Claudia and the kids to the store to pick up some groceries later in the day.
I was too tired to keep walking when we got there so I told her to go on ahead with the kids and
I took a seat at a bench outised with a veteran. Ofcourse when I first met him, he appeared homeless
but I struck up a conversation. He was in the army and came back from Iraq and was now homeless.
I couldnt help but feel sorry for my brother, giving the best years of his youth for his country
and being treated like this. It just isnt fair. I prayed for him on the walk home, hoping
his conditions would improve. That wont be enough though, more needs to be done.
Dougs complaining about his taxes, rightfully so, what could be more important to spend
taxes on than those who've given their lives for this country.

Claudia made a nice dinner, meatloaf with mashed potatoes which we ate. The kids were
stuck in their ipads as always watching something I couldnt make out. Its not right,
it was supposed to be a time for us to eat together but Claudia stopped me before I could
get upset at them for it. You would've done the same thing June.

I love you June,
Good Night.
