Hey man, Im writing to you from 2025, 4 years and a few months since you moved to San Jose.
Everything is going good, nothing you need to immediately worry about. I guess I'll try to predict some
questions you may already be wondering. Im in college now, attening UCSC, kind of a sleeper
and something you probably didnt expect. Your'e about to meet some friends that'll stick with you your
whole life so you better lock in and start being socialble once junior year starts.
You'll still be in good terms with the people back in Irvine, but we dont really talk too much.
Worst of all, Destiny is a dead game, move on. In some happier news, you're not gonna
be single forever!! Isn't that just unexpected. She wont come easy but just try not
to be as awkward as I was. It'll be rough for a few months but try to be open minded and
please try to find a healthy way to spend the time when she isn't there.


Highschool was a good time, you should cherish the next 2 and half
years because I promise you, its not going to get any better. Its the last time
you wont be truly "responsible" for anything. Try getting out more man. Reading more.
Learning more. Hop on rust as soon as you can figure out how to code, its awesome out here,
but most of all, be sincere in what you do. Dont regret having fun, especially right now.
Your grades are going to turn out horrendous but dont sweat it man, even if our parents do.
Take care of our sister, things arent going to be so good when you get to college. Try to understand
our parents more, as hard as that may be, your relationship with them isnt going to get
much closer than it is right now. Dont be afraid to open up to friends.

Honestly, I wish
I could just talk to you instead of having to write a letter, it would make this so much easier.
I think youd be proud of who I am right now, and im proud of who you are right now too,
even if our parents arent. You give me hope that im going to be fine in the future
since I know that you'll be fine in your future. Trust me im not being narcissistic but you
turned out pretty good, no matter what anyone says.

You dont have to believe yourself. Im just going to ask you to believe in the version of me
that believes in you.
