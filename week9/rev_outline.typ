== Introduction
- Gives context about the area, how memory safety vulnerabilities have been the root
  cause of many security incidents in the industry. 
- Nice call to action, asking for the industry to change towards using memory safe
  languages to prevent memory safety vulnerabilities. 

- Ties their Call to action to the reader on a personal level, if the tech we surround
  ourselves with every day is unsafe, it's a tangible threat.

== The Standardization Opportunity

- Gives context relevant to why it's a good time to start a standardization effort now.
  - The smart people have been given enough time to integrate and come up with new
    ways to ensure memory safety, so much so that it's a good time to see how many of
    these solutions work in everyday use and how we can integrate them into how
    the industry does things.

- Tie in that even though these individual contributions exist by these people,
  we really need to standardize them across the industry.

- Lay a foundation to help companies adopt new standards, with varying degrees
  of strictness to also help policymakers figure out how to enforce each level of
  compliance.

== A blueprint for a memory-safe future

- Wish to define the desired outcome of this effort instead of focusing on
