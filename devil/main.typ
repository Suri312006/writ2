// purpose of your text
+ Purpose

  The purpose of my devil's advocate text is to try to approach the topic
  from the mindset of someone who's really enthusiastic and passionate about
  AI. Ideally it would argue against my thesis, saying that AI is revolutionary
  and everyone should embrace using this new technology. They would try to
  convince their reader to continue their usage since the benefits provided
  outweigh the cons of facing copyright.

// who your audience is, reasons they may be receptive to your purpose
// and potential barriers to achieving your purpose.
// Also write about any potential unintended audiences that could come across your work.
// explain how you will connect with them using rhetorical rules
+ Audience

  The audience of this piece would be those who already use AI daily to work
  on programming projects. I want to reach them because they would be
  the most encouraging of using AI even if there are downsides. I want to shape my text to be
  easy to understand and appeal to pathos so, the reader can relate more to
  me as the author and ideally be imprinted.

  Some potential barriers to achieving my purpose would be that I feel like
  my project 4 has a pretty strong point, so I definitely cannot attack it head
  on but would need to employ a more nuanced take. The thing is my thesis for
  project 4 already has quite a niche claim, as it's targeted towards those who
  care about the legality of their code, so if I argue as someone who doesn't
  care about the legality of their code, does it really mean anything? I really
  have to take this into account when coming up with my "claim" (what I want to get
  across in my text, not an explicit claim). An additional way to combat this
  is to really drive into pathos, leaving the logic aside, so the emotional appeal
  might make people forget about the nuance in my project 4.

// what kind of audience would you want to write to.
// Where would your text appear
// how will that impact how you craft your text
// Consider where I would want my text appearing, and where it might end up without me intending to.
+ Context

  I want to write to an audience of AI hype bros who believe it's the greatest
  thing to ever be invented and are trying to brand everything they do, create,
  and use as "AI-powered". Forgive me if I sound salty, but these people are
  my devils and the assignment name is called "Devil's Advocate".

  The best place for my text to appear would be my personal website! I think it would
  play really well into the immersion as these hype bros love blogs, and love posting their
  blogs on Twitter. While I do plan on having this text on my website, I will fortunately not
  be posting it on Twitter.

  This means that I should craft my text to not be too long as to bore my reader
  but be kind of straight to the point while using colloquial language. As for where
  I want my text to end up, ideally it would be on tech twitter or maybe some tech
  content creator talking about the points I make. 


// how will I craft it to have the best chance of achieving my purpose.
// what rhetorical tools will I use and why do I think they will be effective for
// my chosen audience
// explain why I chose to incorporate research and/or citations the way I did.
+ Text 

  In order to craft my text to achieve its purpose, I want to first read other peoples blogs.
  Especially those that tech bros eat up. Mainly going to be a clickbait title with
  colloquial language and an appeal to emotion. This would also mean that any citations I do
  make would probably just be links throughout the post.

  + Genre

    I want to make a semi-serious, fictional but grounded reality blog post
    because it's what's common with the kinds of people who use AI daily.
    It's effective because blogs are usually the sort of place that I and
    many others get new/exciting news or respond to things that are happening
    in the community.

  + Medium

    The medium is going to be a blog that I put up on my website, where I
    post as my devil's advocate, and probably take it down after grading is over. It's a
    cool way to submit it, but it would impact the visibility of my work.
