## 3 things that you did well:

1. I like the standard structure you have planned out, its very reminiscent
of an AP-Lang essay / something similar but it looks good!

2. I like that you have all of your sections planned out with atleast
3 bullet points, which is going to make the writing of your essay quite
straight forward.

3. I like that you promote the idea through a variety of different lenses,
having that strong foundation is really going to help your points shine through.




## 3 things you could do better:

1. Maybe this is just a critique on the draft, but im not completely sure what V2G technology is
and i see that you plan to have background information but I suggest that you maybe
extend the context into a body paragraph as well, maybe putting your body paragraph #4
earlier in your essay so the reader has a more holistic view of the issue at hand
before listening to your arguments.

2. Some of your paragraphs have a lot of bullet points, so remember that this is
supposed to be quite a long essay (1700 words is long to me), so maybe think about
splitting up some of your bulkier paragrahphs into their own sections?

3. Im not sure if you have your sources ready for each point youre planning to make, but
that would be good to have in your outline, but shouldnt be too much of a big deal.
