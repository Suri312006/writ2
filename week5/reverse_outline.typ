= Intro
  - Gives background info on the topic
  - Already using evidence to push a point in the first paragraph? Feels kinda odd.
  - I guess it's alright because they were just trying to back up contextual information.
  - A clear thesis is always nice.

= Body Paragraph 1
  - focusing on the financial disadvantages of the textbook monopoly.
  - I like the usage of paraphrasing your evidence, makes the paragraph flow so much smoother.
  - Lowkey this paragraph is kinda long, with three pieces of direct evidence. I get that
    you want to put all the financial related topics in one paragraph but when you have this
    many, maybe it's not so bad to put some in their own paragraph.
  - yeah a page and half is crazy
  

= Body Paragraph 2
  - Okay nice relevant evidence for the point you're making.
  - again good usage of paraphrasing.
  - One NIT I have is that you say Pearson has influence over America
  but the evidence you use to prove that claim shows that America is the
  one influencing Pearson's profits. If you think about it your evidence doesnt
  support your claim. Maybe use a different piece of evidence?

= Body Paragraph 3
  - I feel like the claim you make in this paragraph is in no way relevant to your thesis? 
    - unless you count the education of religion / what religion is taught is academically
      detrimental? It's kinda like opening up a huge can of worms.
  - Yeah just not really sure what this paragraph brings to the table.

= Body Paragraph 4
  - Okay I definitely think you should have alluded to this in your thesis if you are
    going to dedicate 2 body paragraphs towards religious inclusion in academic institutions.
  - I don't see anything related towards textbook monopoly here.
    - Teaches me to keep my thesis clearly in mind when writing my essay.
= Body Paragraph 5
  - Okay now I'm seeing the relevance with the textbook monopoly here.
  - Very well-formed and talks about the injustice / misrepresentation of non-christian cultures.

= Conclusion
  - Decent conclusion, good summarization
  - Really like the call to action near the end.
