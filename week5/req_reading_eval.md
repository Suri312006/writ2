Step 1: Purpose

    To inform the audience about the terrible effects of the textbook monopoly
    on the students and citizens of this country.

Audience

    Students susceptible to the textbook monopoly Maybe someone who can cause
    change toward this monopoly Maybe the professors taking deals from these
    textbook companies, trying to get them to change their practices.

Context

    The current educational system and how it utilizes textbooks for profit
    instead of education.

Text

    Fairly long essay MLA format Broken up into sections that mostly offer
    background information/context in the beginning

Step 2

    1. They did a good job using paraphrased evidence instead of quoting often.
    2. They fulfilled what they set out to do via thesis.  3. I liked how
    the conclusion succinctly summarizes the points made throughout the long
    essay into a nice, digestible chunk while not sounding overly repetitive.

Step 3

    1. Some of the paragraphs were quite long and very run-on. Maybe break
    them up, or making them shorter and focusing your point would have been
    better. Maybe they were trying to hit a word count, so I can't fault
    them too much for this.

    2. Some of the contents in the later paragraphs weren’t too tied into
    the thesis statement, kind of like you tried to write more than your
    intended thesis allowed. Maybe try including more into your thesis or
    cutting these parts out?

    3. Lastly, the tone of your essay is very "charged," and your message
    would come off as less "pressured" since the underlying information
    already carries itself well without the extra emphasis that’s pushed
    onto the reader.
