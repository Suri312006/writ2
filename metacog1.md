# Part 1 ## Purpose: The purpose of my letter to myself was to give my past
self advice for what’s to come in the future and motivate myself to do
more with the time I had in high school.

## Audience A younger me. I was targeting this letter to myself when I was
in sophomore year, when I had just moved into Cupertino, and it was a rough
time in my life.

## Context The context for my text is quite similar to my answer for the
audience. It was a rough time in my life, so that’s what was going on
around the context of what I was writing to myself.

## Text The text is mostly freeform since I was trying to let my thoughts
flow to my past self. There is also an attempt from me to prove to myself
in the past that I am who I say I am. After that, it’s...

# Part 2

1. The process felt very different from the way I used PACT earlier to analyze
the video because it was about my own writing. In my opinion, it's harder
to make a PACT chart when analyzing my writing because I knew that there
wasn’t a super "deep" meaning. So, when I was doing my PACT analysis, it
was hard to put a description on things that I knew weren’t really there
or weren’t thought about when I was writing.

2. Some insights I gained were that I might want to plan out my writing more,
even when I'm trying to make something more freeform, especially if I want
the writing to come through more clearly.

3. Yes, completing this PACT chart helped me think about how my writing feels
to a reader. But I do think that it’s a lot harder for me to analyze my own
writing, mostly because of what I mentioned earlier. It’s really hard for
me to see my own work from a perspective that isn’t my own. Maybe that’s
a sign for me to get more practice reviewing my own code.

4. Writing this letter to my past self tied in with the lesson on changing
writing because it shows that any piece of writing can be tied to an argument,
however small or niche.
