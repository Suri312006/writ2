\maketitle

All citations are in IEEE Style, as I want some foray into writing academic papers in
the computer science field.


% A brief annotation (150-200 words) which does all four of the following:
% Identifies the purpose/s of the source (What change do you think the author hoped would happen when people read this source?) 
% Explains who you think the intended audience of the source is, and why you think this
% Explains some key strengths of the source and how it can be useful as you investigate your topic
% Explains possible limitations or weaknesses you see in the source
% (eg. credibility, scope of information, author bias, etc.) Keep in mind
% that you might have to do a little additional research to get some other
% perspectives on your source to evaluate its reliability (eg. book reviews,
% author bios, original publication dates etc.)
